It sounds like you're encountering an error related to a broken pipeline and a buffer issue when dealing with large payloads. Here's a general approach to troubleshooting and fixing this type of issue in a Spring application:

### 1. Increase Output Buffer Size
The error might be due to the default output buffer size being too small for the large payload. You can increase the buffer size in your Spring application.

For a Spring Boot application, you can add the following properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

#### `application.properties`
```properties
server.tomcat.max-swallow-size=-1
server.tomcat.max-http-header-size=65536
server.tomcat.max-http-post-size=2097152
```

#### `application.yml`
```yaml
server:
  tomcat:
    max-swallow-size: -1
    max-http-header-size: 65536
    max-http-post-size: 2097152
```

### 2. Check and Optimize Payload Handling
Ensure that your application is optimized for handling large payloads. Here are some steps to consider:

- **Stream Data Processing**: Instead of loading the entire payload into memory, process it in smaller chunks.
- **Adjust HTTP Client/Server Configuration**: Increase timeouts and buffer sizes for both the client and server if necessary.
- **Gzip Compression**: Enable Gzip compression to reduce the payload size.

### 3. Debugging
Enable detailed logging to capture more information about the error. You can increase the logging level in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

#### `application.properties`
```properties
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.coyote.http11=DEBUG
```

#### `application.yml`
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework: DEBUG
    org.apache.coyote.http11: DEBUG
```

### 4. Exception Handling
Implement proper exception handling to gracefully manage errors:

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception e) {
        // Log the exception and return a custom error response
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                             .body("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### 5. Monitor and Test
After applying the changes, monitor the application to ensure that the issue is resolved. Perform stress testing with large payloads to verify the fix.

### Example Configuration
Here's an example of a Spring Boot application configured to handle large payloads with increased buffer sizes and logging:

#### `application.properties`
```properties
server.tomcat.max-swallow-size=-1
server.tomcat.max-http-header-size=65536
server.tomcat.max-http-post-size=2097152
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.coyote.http11=DEBUG
```

#### Custom Exception Handler
```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception e) {
        // Log the exception and return a custom error response
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                             .body("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue related to the broken pipeline and buffer size when dealing with large payloads in your Spring application. If you need more specific guidance, please provide additional details about the error message and the context in which it occurs.
