Using MariaDB or MongoDB for distributed caching involves leveraging their database capabilities to store and manage cache-like data. While these databases are not designed as primary caching solutions like Redis or Memcached, they can effectively serve as distributed caches for certain use cases with proper configuration.

1. Using MariaDB for Distributed Caching

MariaDB is a relational database system, and caching can be implemented by structuring the database as a distributed cache.

Steps to Use MariaDB for Caching

	1.	Create a Cache Table:
	•	Define a table to store cached data, including keys, values, and optional expiration timestamps.
	•	Example schema:

CREATE TABLE cache (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);


	2.	Set Expiry (TTL):
	•	Use an expires_at column to track TTL for cached items.
	•	Periodically clean up expired items using a scheduled job or EVENT.
	•	Example cleanup query:

DELETE FROM cache WHERE expires_at < NOW();


	3.	Access Cache Data:
	•	Retrieve cached values by key:

SELECT value FROM cache WHERE id = 'key' AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > NOW());


	4.	Add/Update Cache Data:
	•	Insert or update cached items with expiration:

INSERT INTO cache (id, value, expires_at)
VALUES ('key', 'cached_value', NOW() + INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
value = VALUES(value), expires_at = VALUES(expires_at);


	5.	Distributed Setup:
	•	Deploy MariaDB in a distributed cluster using Galera Cluster or MariaDB’s replication.
	•	Ensure data replication between nodes for consistency.
	•	Use a load balancer to distribute read/write operations across nodes.
	6.	Indexing:
	•	Create indexes on the id and expires_at columns for efficient querying:

CREATE INDEX idx_cache_expires_at ON cache (expires_at);

2. Using MongoDB for Distributed Caching

MongoDB is a NoSQL database with built-in support for TTL via TTL indexes, making it suitable for distributed caching.

Steps to Use MongoDB for Caching

	1.	Define a Cache Collection:
	•	Create a collection to store key-value pairs and expiration times.
	•	Example document:

{
  "_id": "key",
  "value": "cached_value",
  "createdAt": ISODate("2024-12-01T12:00:00Z")
}


	2.	Enable TTL Index:
	•	Create a TTL index on the createdAt field to automatically remove expired items.
	•	Example:

db.cache.createIndex({ "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 });


	•	This configuration removes documents 1 hour (3600 seconds) after their createdAt timestamp.

	3.	Access Cache Data:
	•	Retrieve cached values by key:

db.cache.findOne({ _id: "key" });


	4.	Add/Update Cache Data:
	•	Insert or update documents in the collection:

db.cache.updateOne(
  { _id: "key" },
  { $set: { value: "cached_value", createdAt: new Date() } },
  { upsert: true }
);


	5.	Distributed Setup:
	•	Deploy MongoDB in a replica set for high availability or as a sharded cluster for scalability.
	•	Use sharding to distribute cache data across multiple nodes based on keys.
	6.	Optimization:
	•	Index the _id field for efficient lookups.
	•	Ensure proper shard keys in sharded setups to avoid hot spots.

	2.	MongoDB:
	•	Your application is NoSQL-based or requires schema flexibility.
	•	You need a native TTL mechanism with minimal configuration.
	•	High throughput and scalability are critical.

Best Practices for Distributed Caching

	1.	Cache Invalidation:
	•	Implement strategies to invalidate or refresh stale data.
	•	Use TTL or versioning mechanisms.
	2.	Replication and Sharding:
	•	Configure replication for fault tolerance and sharding for scalability.
	3.	Monitoring and Metrics:
	•	Monitor cache hit rates and latency to optimize performance.
	•	Use tools like MongoDB Atlas or MariaDB Monitor for insights.
	4.	Consistency:
	•	Decide on the consistency model (strong vs. eventual) based on use case requirements.
